=head1 NAME

XML::Grammar::Vered - a vered by any other name will translate as sweet.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.8

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $xslt = XML::Grammar::Vered->new(
        data_dir => "/path/to/data-dir",
    );

    my $input_filename = '/path/to/my-file-in-vered-format.xml';
    # Throws an exception on failure.
    my $as_docbook = $xslt->perform_xslt_translation(
        {
            output_format => 'docbook'
            source => {file => $input_filename, },
            output => "string",
        }
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Vered-XML is a custom (and incredibly ad-hoc) XML grammar, which was created
for the ability to more easily write and maintain the “Perl Elements to
Avoid” page over at L<http://perl-begin.org/tutorials/bad-elements/> . You
may find it suitable, but chances are you won't. If you find it lacking in
a certain respect, you can either send me a diff to the RNG and XSLT (and
hopefully automated tests as well), or file a bug report and I'll see what
I can do.

Vered gets translated to DocBook 5/XML, and from there to other formats.

“Vered” is the Hebrew word for “a rose”, and I came up with the name because
I did not know what to call this format, and thought of “a rose by any other
name will smell as sweet”.

                    <p>
                    Often when people ask for help with Perl code, they show
                    Perl code that
                    suffers from many bad or outdated <b>elements</b>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Please don't think this advice is
                    meant as gospel. I tried to avoid

                makes the code easier to read and follow.
